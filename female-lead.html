		<h1>Female Lead</h1>
		<p>I believe a strong female lead in movies, books, television, on stage, or any other platform should have a complete story. Some of those elements are: personality, flaws, strengths, attachments, likes, dislikes, and some form of a life outside of just romance. </p>
		<p>Therefore, if I were to hire an actor for a position as a strong female lead they would have to be able to portray such characteristics. While some may not be as developed as others, each characteristic presents a side of the story. The actor I would pick would be able to portray all aspects of the character and be able to change throughout the piece.</p>
